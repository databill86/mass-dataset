# Multilingual speech2speech dataset

This is the repository for the CMU multilingual speech extension data set presented on the paper entitled *A Large and Clean Multilingual Corpus of Sentence Aligned Spoken Utterances Extracted from the Bible*.

The data and scripts will be uploaded in the upcoming weeks.



## Pipeline

* 1) Downloading audio chapters from [bible.is](bible.is)
-> Getting the data
-> Going from multi to one channel

* 2) Aligning the data with [Maus forced aligner](https://clarin.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/BASWebServices/interface/WebMAUSBasic)

* 3) Obtaining speech alignment on a verse level

## Paper Experiments

The implementation and models presented in the paper are available [here](https://github.com/getalp/BibleNet).
